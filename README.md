Web and desktop interface for the [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) AI coding agent. Works alongside the OpenCode TUI.

The OpenCode team is actively working on their own desktop app. I still decided to release this project as a fan-made alternative.

It was entirely built with OpenCode tool - first with the TUI version, then with the first usable version of OpenChamber, which I then used to build the rest.

The whole project was built entirely with AI coding agents under my supervision. It started as a hobby project and proof of concept that AI agents can create genuinely usable software.

## Why use OpenChamber?

- **Cross-device continuity**: Start in TUI, continue on tablet/phone, return to terminal - same session
- **Remote access**: Use OpenCode from anywhere via browser
- **Familiarity**: A visual alternative for developers who prefer GUI workflows

## Features

### Core (all apps versions)

- Branchable conversations: start a new session from any assistant response
- Task tracker UI with live progress and tool summaries
- Model selection UX: favorites, recents, and configurable tool output density

- Session auto-cleanup with configurable retention
- Memory optimizations with LRU eviction

### Web / PWA
